# Mint LUX

The Mint page allow users to mint **LUX** from the protocol at a discount by trading it with i) **liquidity** (_LP tokens_) or ii) **other assets**. The former is called **liquidity minting** and the latter **reserve minting**.

The **minting** action create bonds which take roughly **15 epochs to vest**, and **LUX** tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period.&#x20;

Liquidity minting helps the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while reserve minting allow the protocol to grow its treasury, and thus its Backing per **LUX** faster.
