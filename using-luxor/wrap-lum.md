# Wrap LUM

## What's wLUM?

Users may elect to _wrap_ **** their staked LUX (aka LUM), which converts it to a standardized ERC20 token. Instead of your token _**amount**_ increasing, the _**value**_ of **wLUM** itself increases, thus enabling you to gain the rewards as you normally would with Staking, but without having an increasing amount of tokens in your portfolio.

Users can also unwrap their **wLUM** tokens to receive the underlying **LUM** at any time.

## Why's This Relevant?

In many countries, there is a clear distinction between _Income Tax_ and _Capital Gains Tax._

* **Income Tax** applies to regular income, usually received for work done or investments.
* **Capital Gains Tax** applies to money gained from, for example, the sale of an asset like a house or investment.

In many cases, _Capital Gains Tax is lower than Income Tax_, and so it would be diligent to make it as clear as possible to the taxation authorities of your country or jurisdiction that the income you receive from **LUX** is a **Capital Gain** rather than an **Income**.

## How Does It Work?

Users may wrap their LUM tokens on our [dashboard](https://soul.sh/luxor).

The wLUM token price is calculated as follows:

$$
LUM Price * Index
$$

The price of LUM is always equal to the price of LUX, and the Index is a number used to track the value added to a staked token by rebase rewards. Therefore, the price of wLUM will increase as if it were rebasing, _without needing to rebase_.
