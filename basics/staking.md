# Staking

## What is Staking?

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Luxor.** Stakers stake their **LUX** tokens on [**Luxor Website**](https://soul.sh/luxor) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from [**bond sales**](minting.md), and can vary based on the number of **LUX** staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of **LUX** translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of **LUX** drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked **LUX** balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock LUX and receive an equal amount of Lumens.** Your **Lumens** balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. **Lumens** is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn LUMens and receive an equal amount of LUX tokens.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked **LUX** (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
