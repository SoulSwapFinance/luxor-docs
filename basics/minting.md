## What is Minting? <a href="#what-is-minting" id="what-is-minting"></a>

**Minting is the secondary value accrual strategy of Luxor.** When users mint **LUX** tokens, they are actually selling their assets in order to buy a bond from the protocol. Minting Actions are a cross between a fixed income product, a futures contract, and an option. The protocol quotes the minter with terms for a trade at a future date. These terms include a predefined amount of **LUX** the minter will mint at the completion (end) of their vesting period. The bond becomes redeemable as it vests. In other words, in a 5-day term, after 2 days into the term 40% of the rewards are claimable.

**Minting is an active, short-term strategy.** The price discovery mechanism of the secondary bond market renders mints discounts more or less unpredictable. Therefore minting is considered a more active investment strategy that has to be monitored constantly in order to be more profitable as compared to staking.

**Allowing users to purchases bonds through Minting allows Luxor to accumulate its own liquidity.** We call our own liquidity [**POL**](../resources/glossary.md#pol). More POL ensures there is always locked exit liquidity in our trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders.&#x20;

Since **Luxor** becomes its own market, on top of additional certainty for **LUX** investors, the protocol accrues more and more revenue from LP rewards bolstering our treasury.

### Why is it Minting and not Bonding? <a href="#why-is-it-minting-and-not-bonding" id="why-is-it-minting-and-not-bonding"></a>

Here at **Luxor** we believe that minting better describes the action that users are taking, when purchasing **LUX** with different assets. If you go to the "Mint" page of the website, you will be able to mint **LUX** tokens, effectively selling your assets for discounted **LUX** tokens. Despite the name difference, a Minting Action is exactly the same as a Bond Purchase on Olympus DAO. You can find the minting options for **Luxor** in the [**Mint**](https://app.luxor.money/#mints) **** Page!
